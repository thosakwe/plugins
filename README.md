# plugins
Flutter plugins. Stay tuned.

## Goals
* Provide high-quality, open-source packages and plugins.
  * Cover up holes left by abandonware plugins, and match functionality
  existing in the native app ecosystem.
  * If this picks up enough steam, I may also start creating
  paid packages/plugins, which will ensure a future for this project.
* Always use idiomatic Dart, and aim to match the style used in
`flutter/plugins`.
* Include widgets in plugin packages when possible, so that users do not
always have to deal with plugin API's.
